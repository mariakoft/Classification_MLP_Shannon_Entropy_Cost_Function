# Classification_MLP_Shannon_Entropy_Cost_Function
A MLP Neural Network based on Shannon's Entropy of Error as a cost function , for classification.Implemented in Python

Multiple datasets used. Iris and Wine datasets from UCI Repository presented here.
A pptx presentstion of the algorithm and the results included.

Joined effort of Balas George and Kofterou Maria.
